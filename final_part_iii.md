## [Final Deliverable](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/housing-affordability-crisis-in-portland-oregon/index.html)

  - I ended up making several changes since completion of part II of the assignment. First, I decided to shift my "solutions and call to action" to include both a long term, and short term solution to the issue of affordability in Portland. During my interview process, both people I interviewed mentioned the need for additional long term solutions beyond building more affordable housing. I think many people feel, justifiably, that the real solution lies in bringing people up out of poverty - though providing affordable housing to people can also have that effect, but I digress. The change I made in my final deliverable was including visualizations on the inequitable educational outcomes for people of color in Portland compared with White people. I've included a call to action to reduce educational inequities in the city to the extent possible.
  - Other changes made since part II include smaller visual changes to graphs, titles and legends to reduce clutter and hopefully make the main point easier to pull throughout. Additionally, I've included some data as 'custom made' graphics to metaphorically emphasize some important details. I feel these changes help with the clarity of my project.
