Visualizing Housing Inequality in The Portland Metro Area
  
</h2>

### Project Outline

#### Summary
   - The goal of this project is to highlight the growing level of housing inequality in the greater Portland Metro Area. Housing inequality impacts certain neighborhoods to a greater degree than others in the region. This is a trend that has not been properly explored with data. There have been many anecdotal discussions about the rising level of inequality in Portland, Oregon, but policy makers in the region have failed to clearly depict where the issue is most prevelant.
   - I want to tell this story through a combination of geographic and chart data visualizations. Geographic data visuals will help depict the overall trend of housing inequities in the region, while additional charts and graphics will highlight specific neighborhoods and demographic groups to help explain the disparities more specifically. Below is my outlined story flow.
#### Story Flow
1. Introduction to Portland Demographics
    - geographic data on total population, population by race, household sizes, income, etc by neighborhood
2. Racial Disparities in housing equlity
    - Race focused metrics on rent burdened households, impoverished households, concentration of poverty by neighborhood, correlations between percentage of impoverished hh and percentage of White, African American.
    - Highlighting key focus areas geographically, by neighborhood
3. Policy tools to address housing inequality in the region
    - Looking at low-income housing data, immpact by neighborhood
4. How community members can address housing inequlaity in the region
    - Call to Action: Elect leaders who support affordable housing investment and construction

### Data
   - The primary data source I will utilize for the final project is the [Metro GEOJSON](https://gis.oregonmetro.gov/rlis-metadata/#/summaries) datasets. These datasets connect geographic information about the Portland region with Federally, and locally collected survey and administrative data on a wide suite of demographic data about Portland residents. I will combine this primary data source with data from the [Portland city government on neighborhood boundaries](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1ef75e34b8504ab9b14bef0c26cade2c/explore?location=45.542626%2C-122.667150%2C11.90) to create by neighborhood data visualizations to highlight the geographic boundaries of this issue. Additionally, I will seek out other, non spatial data to include as charts and graphics to provide further context on the issue.


### Method and Medium
   - I will utilize Shorthand in order to create my final data visualization for presentation at the end of the course.
