# Visual Design Critique

### - Original Graphic
  - The chosen graphic for this project represents the total number of acres burned and total number of fires by year for the past 10 years within the United States. This graphic is part of a [larger visualization project](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/09/10/wildfires-california-washington-oregon-drought-heat-climate-change-graphics/5764156002/) from USA Today which attempts to put the wildly large wildfires from recent years into a context that's more easy to understand. 
  - They do so by comparing the total number of acres burned by wildfires in one year to the size of New York City. This aspect of the visualization works well, but the graphic which I've chosen to redesign feels like an oversight in comparison. While the aesthetics of the graphic are not too bad, it does little to provide useful information on the topic of concern. The visualization is limited to the past 10 years of data, so it does not depict the historical trend and increasing size of fires overtime.
  - In addition, the years are ordered chronoligically making it more difficult to pick out the worst, or best years for wildfires. The line chart depicting the number of fires per year also provides little useful context. There doesn't appear to be any correlation between the number of acres burned and the number of fires per year so this added information just clutters the visualization.
  - For these reasons, I've chosen to redesign this visualization to include historical context for the data. In the context this data is presented, which is informing normal people about the outlandish size of recent wildfires, providing the historical context better informs people about how bad the situation is today. This would hopefully move people to demand or create change as much as possible.

### - Wireframing The Redesign
  - I want to depict the growth of these fires overtime. One option is to create a dot chart with the number of acres burned on one axis and years on the other. There are a number of ways to depict the increase here. First, the chart itself would show the change. In addition, I can use color or size to depict the increase over time. Finally, I could highlight a certain subset of years to show that many of the worst years have happened most recently. 
  - The following wireframe project depicts my conceptual ideas for this idea. Overall, I want to highlight the up and to the right trend in the datapoints which clearly depicts a growing problem over time. I've also used size in both charts to depict the size of the fires growing over time. Though utilizing size in dot charts can be problematic as it's hard to decipher scale, I think that in this case it is simply reinforcing the trend that's clearly depicted by the graphic itself. I also included a trend line in one graphic to further drive home the point that wildfires are increasing in size over time. While trend lines are a more complex concept, I think in this visualization it's fairly clear what the line is representing.
