### Status Quo:

### Visualizing Debt Over Time:
  - In this redesign, I have taken the data presented by OECD, and redesigned it to depict the change in the GDP-Debt ratio over time by country. This allows the viewer to see at the country level how trends in debt have been changing over time since the 90s.
