### Visualizing Debt Over Time:
  - In this redesign, I have taken the data presented by OECD, and redesigned it to depict the change in the GDP-Debt ratio over time by country. This allows the viewer to see at the country level how trends in debt have been changing over time since the 90s.

### Creating A New Story From The Data:
  - In this final design, I have grouped countries by region (Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania), and aggregated GDP-Debt ratios within these over-arching regions. The story here is directly related to the Covid-19 Pandemic, and it's effect on global markets. While all markets were effected by this pandemic, I largely wanted to focus on the Americas and Europe, as these were two of the hardest hit areas around the globe. Additionally, they account for much of the global GDP. Therefore, I have designed this visualization to highlight the GDP-Debt ratio for the Americas as well as Europe, but still included the other regions as controls or additional datapoints for comparison.
    - It's worth noting that for both the Americas and Europe, the Covid-19 Pandemic has had a greater impact on government debt levels than during the 2008 financial crisis. At that time, the ratio increased by 15% and 17% respectivelly from 2007 to 2009 for the Americas and Europe. During the Covid-19 Pandemic, government debt increased by 19% and 18% respectively for the Americas and Europe. It is also worth noting that government debt started at a more elevated level during the most recent uptick. In 2019, government debt was at 89% and 80% of GDP for the Americas and Europe while in 2007 government debt was at 53% and 54% respectivelly. Both the relative increase and the high starting levels indicate poor economic trends leading up to and following the Covid-19 Pandemic.
