# My Portfolio
  - ### this is my portfolio for data vizualization projects!

  - ## About Me
    - My name is Adrien (he/him/his), and I am from Portland, Oregon. I am a Public Policy and Management Flagship student in my second year at Heinz College. I am interested in data visualization for public policy because I believe the proper visualization of data can be a powerful tool for portraying stories that otherwise would go unseen. This is especially important in public policy, as so many issues deal with marginalized groups of people whose voices are inadequately raised in the public sphere. I am interested in transportation, housing, and community development issues!

  - ## What I Hope To Learn
    - In this class, I hope to learn proper design techniques to improve my data visualizations moving forward. I also hope to learn how to use software which allow for more manual manipulation of data visualizations that make for more impactful story telling. 


# Projects
- ### Please see the [Assignment Details](assignment_detail.md) page for additional details on each project

  - ## [Visualizing Government Debt](government_debt_visualization.md)

#### Data Visualizations of government debt tend to display data in bar charts making it difficult to understand trends over time by country.

#### It is possible to display this data in a more useful way by using [sparklines](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR).
